## Overview

The F1® 23 Game supports the output of certain game data across UDP connections. This data can be used to supply race information to external applications or to drive certain hardware (e.g. motion platforms, force feedback steering wheels, and LED devices).

The following information summarizes these data structures so that developers of supporting hardware or software can configure them to work correctly with the F1® 23 Game.

**Note**: To ensure that you are using the latest specification for this game, please check our official forum page [here](#).

If you cannot find the information that you require, please contact the team via the official forum thread listed above. For any bugs with the UDP system, please post a new bug report on the F1® 23 Game forum.

## Packet Information

### Packet Types

Each packet carries different types of data rather than having one packet that contains everything. The header in each packet describes the packet type and versioning info, making it easier for applications to check they are interpreting the incoming data in the correct way. Please note that all values are encoded using Little Endian format. All data is packed.

The following data types are used in the structures:

| Type   | Description                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| uint8  | Unsigned 8-bit integer                   |
| int8   | Signed 8-bit integer                     |
| uint16 | Unsigned 16-bit integer                  |
| int16  | Signed 16-bit integer                    |
| uint32 | Unsigned 32-bit integer                  |
| float  | Floating point (32-bit)                  |
| double | Double-precision floating point (64-bit) |
| uint64 | Unsigned 64-bit integer                  |
| char   | Character                                |

### Packet Header

Each packet has the following header:

```c
struct PacketHeader {
    uint16    m_packetFormat;            // 2023
    uint8     m_gameYear;                // Game year - last two digits e.g. 23
    uint8     m_gameMajorVersion;        // Game major version - "X.00"
    uint8     m_gameMinorVersion;        // Game minor version - "1.XX"
    uint8     m_packetVersion;           // Version of this packet type, all start from 1
    uint8     m_packetId;                // Identifier for the packet type
    uint64    m_sessionUID;              // Unique identifier for the session
    float     m_sessionTime;             // Session timestamp
    uint32    m_frameIdentifier;         // Identifier for the frame the data was retrieved on
    uint32    m_overallFrameIdentifier;  // Overall identifier for the frame, doesn't reset after flashbacks
    uint8     m_playerCarIndex;          // Index of player's car in the array
    uint8     m_secondaryPlayerCarIndex; // Index of secondary player's car in the array (splitscreen), 255 if no second player
};

### Motion Packet

The motion packet gives physics data for all the cars being driven.

N.B. For the normalized vectors below, to convert to float values divide by `32767.0f` – 16-bit signed values are used to pack the data on the assumption that direction values are always between `-1.0f` and `1.0f`.

### Session History Packet

This packet contains lap times and tyre usage for the session. It works slightly differently from other packets. To reduce CPU and bandwidth, each packet relates to a specific vehicle and is sent every 1/20 s, cycling through cars. Therefore, in a 20-car race, you should receive an update for each vehicle at least once per second.

- **Frequency**: 20 per second but cycling through cars
- **Size**: 1460 bytes
- **Version**: 1

```c
struct LapHistoryData {
    uint32    m_lapTimeInMS;          // Lap time in milliseconds
    uint16    m_sector1TimeInMS;      // Sector 1 time in milliseconds
    uint8     m_sector1TimeMinutes;   // Sector 1 whole minute part
    uint16    m_sector2TimeInMS;      // Sector 2 time in milliseconds
    uint8     m_sector2TimeMinutes;   // Sector 2 whole minute part
    uint16    m_sector3TimeInMS;      // Sector 3 time in milliseconds
    uint8     m_sector3TimeMinutes;   // Sector 3 whole minute part
    uint8     m_lapValidBitFlags;     // Lap validity flags (0x01 = lap valid, etc.)
};

```c
struct TyreStintHistoryData {
    uint8     m_endLap;               // Lap the tyre usage ends on (255 if current tyre)
    uint8     m_tyreActualCompound;   // Actual tyres used

## Restricted Data (Your Telemetry Setting)

There is some data in the UDP that you may not want other players to see in multiplayer games. This is controlled by the **"Your Telemetry"** setting in the telemetry options.

### Options:

- **Restricted** (Default) – Other players viewing the UDP data will not see values for your car.
- **Public** – All other players can see all the data for your car.
- **Show Online ID** – This additional option allows other players to view your online ID / gamertag in their UDP output.

### Data items that are set to zero if "Your Telemetry" is set to "Restricted":

#### **Car Status Packet:**

- `m_fuelInTank`
- `m_fuelCapacity`
- `m_fuelMix`
- `m_fuelRemainingLaps`
- `m_frontBrakeBias`
- `m_ersDeployMode`
- `m_ersStoreEnergy`
- `m_ersDeployedThisLap`
- `m_ersHarvestedThisLapMGUK`
- `m_ersHarvestedThisLapMGUH`
- `m_enginePowerICE`
- `m_enginePowerMGUK`

#### **Car Damage Packet:**

- `m_frontLeftWingDamage`
- `m_frontRightWingDamage`
- `m_rearWingDamage`

## FAQS

### How do I enable the UDP Telemetry Output?

In F1 23, the UDP telemetry output is controlled via the in-game menus. To enable this, enter the options menu from the main menu (triangle/Y), then enter the settings menu. The UDP option will be at the bottom of the list.

- From there, you will be able to:
    - Enable / disable the UDP output.
    - Configure the IP address and port for the receiving application.
    - Toggle broadcast mode and set the send rate.

**Broadcast Mode** transmits the data across the network subnet, allowing multiple devices on the same subnet to receive the information. In broadcast mode, it is not necessary to set a target IP address, just a target port for applications to listen on.

### Advanced PC Users:

You can additionally edit the game’s configuration XML file to configure UDP output. The file is located here (after an initial boot of the game):

```
...\Documents\My Games\<game_folder>\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml
```

You should see the following tag:

```xml
<motion>
    ...
    <udp enabled="false" broadcast="false" ip="127.0.0.1" port="20777" sendRate="20" format="2023" yourTelemetry="restricted" onlineNames="off" />
    ...
</motion>
```

Here you can set the values manually. Any changes made within the game while it is running will overwrite changes made manually. Note that the `enabled` flag now represents a state.

### What has changed since last year?

F1® 23 sees the following changes to the UDP specification:

- Added game year to packet header – apps can identify which F1 game the data is coming from.
- Temperature and speed units choice for players sent in session packet.
- Platform of players added to lobby info and participants packets.
- Added flag to indicate whether a player has their “Show online names” flag set in participants packet.
- Added whole minute part to sector times in lap data and session history packets.
- Damage packet now updates at 10/s.
- Separated corner-cutting warnings in the lap data packet.
- Added a new tyre sets packet to provide more details about tyre sets for each car.
- Added time deltas for cars in the lap data packet.
- Added overall frame identifier to packet header to help with handling flashbacks.
- Added Red Flag event.
- Added Safety car, VSC, and Red Flag counts to session data.
- Added more physics data to the motion packet.
- Added Overtake event.
- Added power output readings for the engine.
- Added C0 tyre type.
- Added a new Motion Ex packet and moved player car settings from Motion packet to stop it from getting too large, added vertical wheel forces.

### What is the order of the wheel arrays?

All wheel arrays are in the following order:

1. Rear Left (RL)
2. Rear Right (RR)
3. Front Left (FL)
4. Front Right (FR)

---

### Do the vehicle indices change?

During a session, each car is assigned a vehicle index. This will not change throughout the session, and all arrays use this vehicle index to dereference the correct piece of data.

---

### What coordinate systems are used?

A visual representation of the coordinate system used with the F1 telemetry data is provided in the document (not displayed here).

---

### What encoding format is used?

All values are encoded using **Little Endian** format.

---

### Are the data structures packed?

Yes, all data is packed. No padding is used.

---

### How many cars are in the data structures?

The maximum number of cars in the data structures is 22. You should check the data item called `m_numActiveCars` in the participants packet to see how many cars are active in the race. However, to know if a car is actively providing data, check the individual result status of each car in the lap data packet.

---

### How often are updated packets sent?

For packets updated at the "Rate as specified in the menus," you can be guaranteed that all relevant packets will be sent together on the same frame. However, the reliability of the network affects whether they are received correctly.

---

### Will my old app still work with F1 23?

F1 23 supports the previous two UDP formats, so most older apps using these formats should work with little or no change. You can select "UDP Format" to either "2022" or "2021" in the options menu.

---

### How do I enable D-BOX output?

D-BOX output is supported on the PC platform. You can enable it via the in-game menu: **Game Options -> Settings -> UDP Telemetry Settings -> D-BOX**.

---

### How can I disable in-game support for LED devices?

The F1 game has native support for some LED devices, such as the Leo Bodnar SLI Pro and Fanatec steering wheels. You can disable the native support by editing the `hardware_settings_config.xml` file in the following location:

```
...\Documents\My Games\<game_folder>\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml
```

Set the following flags to `false` to disable LED output:

```xml
<led_display fanatecNativeSupport="true" sliProNativeSupport="true" />
```

---

### Can I configure the UDP output using an XML file?

Yes, PC users can manually edit the configuration XML file to set up UDP output:

```
...\Documents\My Games\<game_folder>\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml
```

Here is the relevant XML tag:

```xml
<motion>
    ...
    <udp enabled="false" broadcast="false" ip="127.0.0.1" port="20777" sendRate="20" format="2023" yourTelemetry="restricted" onlineNames="off" />
    ...
</motion>
```
