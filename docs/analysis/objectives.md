# Objectives For The Proposed System

### Objective:

- The program should help the player improve

### Explanation

- The program should generate from telemetry data, areas which the player could improve on, providing personally-tailored practice programmes/tasks to facilitate this. Additionally, the program will provide individual driver ratings according to different categories and areas of skills, which can then be compared to themselves and others in order for players to be able to measure their performance and improvement.

### Objective

The program should present a visual representation of the Player’s telemetry data.

### Explanation

The program should generate graphs and charts of individual telemetry data points e.g. tyre wear, fuel levels, slip angle, slip ratio, braking, throttle etc.

---

### Objective

The program should make observations from a large data set

### Explanation

The program should collect as many relevant data points as possible provided by F1® 23’s telemetry output interface, and its processes should account for multiple inputs when running calculations. This should include data on the vehicle’s motion/position, lap and session information, weather and environment information and information on the car’s setup and status.

### Objective

The program should provide an interface for comparison between multiple players

### Explanation

The program should contain leaderboards for players to compare between, as well as include high level example data from players, so that the program may create comparisons between a player and an ‘optimal’ performance in order to generate analysis from. The program should also allow for the overlaying and direct comparison of player graphs for individual data points in addition to more simplified timing and rating leaderboards.
